# dev-practices
##Mission for the Guide
The purpose of this document is to foster community learning by laying down a
collaboration framework for to development standards and best practices. Our
 goal is to inspire a culture of continual learning through knowledge sharing. 
 We seek to create a space where we continually mentor and encourage one
 another to become better developers while respecting each others' knowledge
 and expertise.

##Guide to the Guide
###Best Practices vs. Standards
In this guide, we have two types of documents: "best practices" and "standards."

####Standards
A "standard" is a required practice for CoLab developers. For example, all
CoLab developers must use git for version control.

####Best Practices
A "best practice" is a really good idea, a strong preference. It is possible
that some will hold other opinions on best practices and may consciously choose
to take another course. For example, some may feel that the use of pure CSS
over SASS when possible is a best practice.

####Tutorials/Notes
Tutorials and notes may be placed in subfolders. For instance, in the css-sass
folder, there is a folder called "flexbox" which may contain documentation of
bugs in the flexbox specification or tutorials about flexbox.

###Procedure
We all participate in creating best practices and standards. If you want to
recommend a standard or best practice, branch and create a pull request. Most
of the time you'll probably see your best practice merged in.

If you want institutional change (i.e. CoLab uses grunt but you want us to
switch to gulp), and you feel that many people will not yet agree with you,
propose and plan a roundtable (i.e. on the subject of "build tools"). Invite
your co-workers to discuss the issue together. If a consensus emerges, or even
if it doesn't, create a pull request and see what happens.

Make your commits meaningful. For a model of excellent commits,
see [thoughtbot's commit log](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/commits/master).
