# dev-practices
##Mission for the Guide##
The purpose of this document is to lay down consensus development standards based on best practices. But above all, it is intended to inspire a culture of continual learning through knowledge sharing. We seek to create a space where we continually mentor and encourage one another to become better developers while respecting each others' knowledge and expertise.

##Guide to the Guide##
###Best Practices vs. Standards###
Best practices are things that many people think are best to do. Development standards are requirements for good development. For instance we develop using git (a standard) and most of use prefer SASS for CSS (a best practice).

###Development Wisdom###
Development cannot be fully distilled into tools and practices. Development consists of thousands of micro-decisions that cannot be fully documented that result in wise coding. "Use git flow" is an example of either a best practice or a standard, but "Learn regular expressions and use them for your daily text-editing tasks" or "If you find an un-commented code section that takes you a few minutes to understand, comment it for the next developer." are not truly a best practices, nor are they standards, they are sage pieces of advice. And development wisdom can be a place to have fun/

###Procedure###
We all participate in creating best practices. If you want to recommend a best practice, branch and create a pull request. Most of the time you'll probably see your best practice merged in.

If you want institutional change (i.e. CoLab uses grunt but you want us to switch to gulp), and you feel that many people will not yet agree with you, propose and plan a "build tool" roundtable. Invite your co-workers to discuss the issue together. If a consensus emerges, or even if it doesn't, create a pull request and see what happens.

Make your commits meaningful. For a model of excellent commits, see [thoughtbot's commit log](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/commits/master).
